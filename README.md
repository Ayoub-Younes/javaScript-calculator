# JavaScript Calculator

This is a JavaScript Calculator project created as part of my JavaScript Libraries certification from FreeCodeCamp. The project allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Overview

The Calculator lets users input numbers and operators to perform calculations. The layout is responsive, designed using CSS Grid for simplicity. Users can clear their input, perform multiple operations consecutively, and handle decimal points. The project also prevents invalid inputs, like multiple consecutive operators, ensuring accurate calculations.
